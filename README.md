# GenomeAnnotation

This tool is created for the purpose of annotating gene sequences. 

Running AAACounter.sh outputs the number of amino acids in all 14 bacterial genomes and the number of DNA bases or their open reading frames (ORFs). This shell file utilizes two other python files (aa_and_dna_calc.py and amino acid_calculator.py)
