# GenomeAnnotation

This tool is created for the purpose of annotating gene sequences. 

Running AAACounter.sh outputs the number of amino acids in all 14 bacterial genomes and the number of DNA bases or their open reading frames (ORFs). This shell file utilizes two other python files (aa_and_dna_calc.py and amino acid_calculator.py) 

The folder run_prodigal_one_file contains a shell script that utilizes a python script to run the prodigal of only one .fna file of bacterial genome. The folder also contains the outputs in files formats (.gbk) and (.faa) for genes and proteins, respectively.
